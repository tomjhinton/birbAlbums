# birbAlbums

For @sableRaph's weekly Creative Coding Challenge. The Challenge topic was Album Cover's.
Made a little model in blender, baked the texture. Loaded it with three.js. Uses cannon to do physics simulations. Generates a new album cover if you click the counter. Band names layered over by creating a hidden Canvas element and using that as a texture within a glsl shader. New shaders created for each cover with some template literals to allow for pretending Math.random() is me being creative. Does have a very hacky and horrible musical element, just pretend it was mastered by Rashad Becker and released on PAN or whatever. That's done with Tone.js. Pretty sure I only used samples that come with Tidal so should be ok to stick wherever?
